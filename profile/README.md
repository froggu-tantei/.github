## Developer Education Through Real-World Practice
> "Learning by building, teaching by doing" - Bridging the gap between theory and industry practice
## Who We Are üåü

We're just a bunch of nerds who decided that building silly stuff together is way more fun than doing it alone and share it with people that want to learn!

## Our Mission üöÄ
Froggu Tantei Labs is an innovative developer education platform that transforms learning through hands-on project development. We believe the best way to master technology is by building real applications while being mentored by experienced practitioners.

## üèóÔ∏è Our Learning Philosophy
